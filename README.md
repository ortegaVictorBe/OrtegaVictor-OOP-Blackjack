# PHP - Blackjack - BeCode :black_joker:

## Brief :clipboard:

We have to make the Blackjack game with PHP

---

## The Mission :speech_balloon:

---

Let's make a game in PHP: Blackjack! To keep the code structured we are going to use classes and objects.

Your coach has provided you with some starter classes that you can use for the game, to help you out on your first OOP challenge. First spent some time reading these classes and really understand what they are doing. If something in the syntax is unclear, google it first and then ask your coach.

If this is still an unclear subject for you don't feel bad to google some basic OOP articles, or ask your coach. It is normal if this feels difficult, because object oriented programming is a really complex subject!.
